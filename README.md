# opendoc
Converters and programs for problematic document formats like PDF, XLS into degradable, portable formats like CSV and JSON and Markdown. Thanks @kaihendry for annoying me on #hackerspacesg enough to think about this.

## License
I chose the MIT license for starters, just in case someone better than me, or my future self, decides to make something that's worth anything out of this. :) 

## Install
Currently, there is nothing to install. This is just an idea that jumped into my head. I hope this won't take too long to get to fruition.

## Feedback
Send any suggestions or comments to my github username at gmail dot com.
